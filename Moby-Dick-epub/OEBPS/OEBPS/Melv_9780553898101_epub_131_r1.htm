<p class="ct">THE PEQUOD MEETS THE DELIGHT</p>
<p class="cotx1"><span class="big"><span class="big"><span class="big"><strong>T</strong></span></span></span>HE INTENSE
Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to<a id="GBS.0646.02"/> carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.</p>
<p class="tx">Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.</p>
<p class="tx">“Hast seen the White Whale?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail;<a id="GBS.0646.03"/> and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.</p>
<p class="tx">“Hast killed him?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The harpoon is not yet forged that will ever do that,” answered the other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.</p>
<p class="tx">“Not forged!” and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in<a id="GBS.0646.04"/> this hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then God keep thee, old man—see'st thou that”—pointing to the hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only <em>that</em> one I bury;<a id="GBS.0646.05"/> the rest were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.</p>
<p class="tx">But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape<a id="GBS.0647.01"/> the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.</p>
<p class="tx">As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy hanging at the Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.</p>
<p class="tx">“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake. “In vain,<a id="GBS.0647.02"/> oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin!”</p>
