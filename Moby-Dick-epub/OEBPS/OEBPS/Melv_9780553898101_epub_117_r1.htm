<p class="ct">THE WHALE WATCH</p>

whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.</p>
<p class="tx">The waif-pole was thrust upright into<a id="GBS.0599.02"/> the dead whale's spout-hole; and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.</p>
<p class="tx">Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the whale, and tapped<a id="GBS.0599.03"/> the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.</p>
<p class="tx">Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.</p>
<p class="tx">“Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that<a id="GBS.0599.04"/> neither hearse nor coffin can be thine?”</p>
<p class="tx">“And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”</p>
<p class="tx">“But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with<a id="GBS.0599.05"/> the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a sight we shall not soon see.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And what was that saying about thyself?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was it not so?<a id="GBS.0600.01"/> Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby-Dick and survive it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”</p>
<p class="tx">Both were<a id="GBS.0600.02"/> silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship.</p>
