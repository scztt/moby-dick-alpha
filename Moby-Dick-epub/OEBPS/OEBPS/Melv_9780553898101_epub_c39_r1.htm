ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I've been thinking over it ever since, and that ha, ha's the final consequence. Why so? Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer; and come what will, one comfort's always left—that unfailing comfort is, it's all predestinated. I heard not all his talk with<a id="GBS.0222.02"/> Starbuck; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too.

<br/>And break on the lips while meeting.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx">A brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(<em>Aside</em>) he's my superior, he has his too, if I'm not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir, just through with this job—coming.</p>
